<h1>Types of cars</h1>
<h3><i>Sedens</i></h3>
<img src="./../image/Hyundai-Verna-Side.webp" alt="car image" height="300px"></br>
</br>
<p>
    Derived from the Latin term “sedere” which means “to sit”, sedans are designed to provide utmost comfort and convenience for passengers both at the front as well as the rear. The major component of a sedan is its longer body that’s built with a three-box configuration consisting of pillars identified as A, B, and C pillars. Compared to hatchbacks, sedans have a separate boot compartment, which exists as an addition to the vehicle’s bodyline. Thus, when you open up a sedan’s boot, you’re opening just the boot and not the car itself. With the boot being a separate compartment, a sedan usually has a larger boot space than a hatchback.  
</p>
</br>
<p>
    Sedans in India range from compact sedans measuring just under 4 meters to lengthy luxury sedans measuring more than 5 meters in length. The different construction of a sedan increases its price in comparison to hatchbacks but also allows for more interior passenger space and leg room. Larger capacity engines are more common in sedans, with the smallest being a 1.0-litre engine in the smaller sedans. In terms of engines, the smallest you will find on a sedan is a 1.0-litre engine, that only increases for the larger sedan cars.

<h3><i>SUVs(Sport Utility vehicle)</i></h3>

</br>
</br>
<p>
    Quite popular in the Indian market, SUV is a car body-type that comprises vehicles that are both passenger vehicles as well as off-roaders. SUVs are generally large and measure well over the 4 meter mark, with compact SUVs being the exception, coming under 4 meters. Built with a tall bodyline, SUVs provide the driver with a commanding view of the road ahead. Moreover, SUVs have high ground clearance providing better terrain handling capability as well as a stance higher from the ground. This is a feature that makes them distinct from all other vehicle body-types.
</p>
</br>
<p>
    In terms of comfort, a compact SUV provides interior space similar to a premium hatchback while midsize and larger SUVs provide more spacious cabins. Their high ground clearance makes SUVs particularly suited to handling rough terrain, while they’re also equipped with terrain modes, 4-wheel drive systems and other off-road specific features. In terms of engines, SUVs feature torque-focused engines that provide better power output at lower RPMs for improved traction in rough terrain.

<h3><i>MUVs</i></h3>

</br>
<p>
    Multi-utility vehicles (MUVs) or Multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) are built for maximum practicality and utility. An MUV vehicle is often dubbed as a people carrier due to its ability to seat as many as 10 people. You will often find MUVs being the car of choice for long distance travel due to their increased interior space and higher seating capacity.
</p>
</br>
<p>
     MUVs are generally built with a high strength chassis frame, capable of carrying extra passengers   as well as luggage. In terms of day-to-day utility, MUVs generally offer better fuel efficiency when compared to SUVs that are similarly sized. Typical powertrains found on MUVs feature large capacity engines of 1.5-litres or more, with some specific cars coming with 1.0-litre engines. For those who want practicality and efficiency over rugged looks and off-road capabilities, an MUV could be the perfect fit.</p>

    Mahindra is currently the only car maker in India to offer electric cars for personal mobility. And the brand plans to take the count up with the electric version of the KUV100 which was showcased at the Auto Expo 2018.
