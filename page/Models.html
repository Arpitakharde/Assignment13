        The Toyota Camry Hybrid is a premium executive sedan priced at Rs 41.7 lakh (ex-showroom). As a result, it goes up against the Skoda Superb, and even ventures into the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and Mercedes A-Class territory. Yes, this Toyota doesn’t have the same snob value, but remains one of the unique long three-box sedans with its own USPs, like hybrid power, focus on rear-seat comfort, etc. all of which we will get to in a bit. Camry is Toyota’s only sedan in India and now gets cosmetic updates and new features in its eighth-gen avatar.
